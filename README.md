In this module, I will be updating the topic wise SQL tutorial notes which is very useful for a fresher to start with MYSQL from basics

# Introduction üëã

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
- This tutorial will give you a quick start to SQL. 
- It covers most of the topics required for a basic understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how it works.

# A Brief History of SQL ‚åö

**1970** ‚àí Dr. Edgar F. "Ted" Codd of IBM is known as the father of relational databases. He described a relational model for databases.

**1974** ‚àí Structured Query Language appeared.

**1978** ‚àí IBM worked to develop Codd's ideas and released a product named System/R.

**1986** ‚àí IBM developed the first prototype of relational database and standardized by ANSI. The first relational database was released by Relational Software which later came to be known as Oracle.

# Why to Learn SQL ü§î

- SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. 
- All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

Also, they are using different dialects, such as ‚àí

### 1) MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
### 2) Oracle using PL/SQL,
### 3) MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.

# Applications of SQL ‚úîÔ∏è

- SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases.
- I'm going to list few of them here:

### - Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.

### - Allows users to describe the data.

### - Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.

### - Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.

### - Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.

### - Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.

### - Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.
